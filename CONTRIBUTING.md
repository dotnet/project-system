# Contributing

We welcome contributions. Great ways to contribute include trying things out, filing bugs, joining in design conversations and fixing issues. If you're looking at places to contribute code, take a look at our [help wanted issues](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22).

If you want to submit a feature or a substantial code contribution, please discuss it first with the the team by [filing an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues/new), making sure it follows our [Roadmap](docs/repo/roadmap.md).
