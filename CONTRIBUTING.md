# Contributing

We welcome contributions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

Great ways to contribute include trying things out, filing bugs, joining in design conversations and fixing issues. If you're looking at places to contribute code, take a look at our [help wanted issues](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

If you want to submit a feature or a substantial code contribution, please discuss it first with the the team by [filing an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/new), making sure it follows our [Roadmap](docs/repo/roadmap.md).
