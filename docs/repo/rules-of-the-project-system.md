# Rules of the Project System

The following are a set of rules and guidelines that we should follow as we write the new project system.

## Upgrade
- Developers will not be prompted to upgrade, convert or otherwise change their existing projects when opened in Visual Studio 2017. 
    
- Existing projects once opened in Visual Studio 2017 and saved, can be reopened in previous versions of Visual Studio right back to Visual Studio 2010

## Project Files
- New properties and items that are used only for Visual Studio or designer purposes should not be persisted in the project file. This file should be treated as a "user" file and as such, should be readable, easily editable and understandable by the user.

## Visual Studio
- Project System behavioral differences between languages (C#, Visual Basic or F#) or project types (WinForms, Web, etc), such as which files to nest or hide by default, should be configurable and persisted in the associated Microsoft.[Language].Designer.targets file.
