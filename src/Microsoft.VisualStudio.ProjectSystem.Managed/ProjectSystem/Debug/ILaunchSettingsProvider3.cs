/// <remarks>
/// <para>
///     The existing <see cref="ILaunchSettingsProvider.AddOrUpdateProfileAsync"/> method
///     does not work well in situations where multiple update operations may run
///     concurrently because the retrieval of the current set of values is separated from
///     the later update. If operations A and B each retrieve the current profile, make
///     their changes, and then apply them there is a very good chance that A's changes
///     will overwrite B's or the other way around. The new method introduced here makes
///     retrieving and updating a profile an single operation.
/// </para>
/// <para>
///     The <see cref="ILaunchSettingsProvider.AddOrUpdateGlobalSettingAsync"/> method has
///     similar problems.
