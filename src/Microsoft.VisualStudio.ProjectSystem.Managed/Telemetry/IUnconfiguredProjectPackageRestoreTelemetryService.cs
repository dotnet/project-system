     * The managed project system is responsible for requesting NuGet restore for projects.
     * This is done by invoking the NuGet project nomination APIs and is necessary to ensure
     * that all the information necessary for features like intellisense is generated.
     * 
     * This interface enables the package restore components to post telemetry events indicating
     * whether the initialization of the package restore components (for the UnconfiguredProject)
     * suceeded and whether the project was nominated for a package restore.
     * Project nomination is indicated by these events:
     * 
     *  1. PackageRestoreOperationNames.BeginNominateRestore
     *  2. PackageRestoreOperationNames.EndNominateRestore
     * 
     * Ultimately, the most important step in the package restore process is notifying the
     * operation progress system that package restore is complete. That process happens for
     * configured projects and is therefore handled by the <see cref="IConfiguredProjectPackageRestoreTelemetryService"/>.
